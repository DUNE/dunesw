# dunesw

dunesw is the top-level software product, split from the legacy dunetpc repository in Fermilab's Redmine instance.  It contains art/LArSoft-based software that supports DUNE's liquid argon TPCs -- the far detector (horizontal and vertical drift), ProtoDUNE-SP, ProtoDUNE-DP, ProtoDUNE-VD, ICEBERG and associated cold-boxes.  Further information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/DUNE/dunesw/wiki).
