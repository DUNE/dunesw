 * Provides an environment for easy set up of DUNE-aware tests.
 * Keep in mind that the channel mapping algorithm must be hard-coded and, if
 * using Boost unit test, the configuration file location must be hard coded too
 * (or you can use the provided configuration).

     * This class needs to be fully constructed by the default constructor
     * in order to be useful as Boost unit test fixture.
     * It is supposed to be passed as a template parameter to another class
     * that can store an instance of it and extract configuration information
     * from it.
     * 
     * This class should be used with WireReadoutCRMGeom.

     * We reuse BasicGeometryEnvironmentConfiguration as base class and we
     * override its setup.
